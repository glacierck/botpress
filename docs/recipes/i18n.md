Support of multiple languages means answering several questions:

1. How would the bot know which language to use?
2. How would admin add text-translations?
3. How would bot render appropriate content?

# Selecting language

The scenarios may be different here and depend on your needs starting with env-variables and finishing with fetching language of the user from his profile at third-party service.

In our case, we'll keep things simple and just a [add choice](/docs/getting_started/trivia_skills/) for the user at the beginning of the conversation.

You can then store info on user's choice in the `state` by preparing [simple action](/docs/getting_started/trivia_actions/) for this purpose. Let's assume we have English and Arabic languages and we'll set `state.language` either to "En" or "Ar" based on it.

# Adopting content schema

For this purpose you can [add custom content type](/docs/getting_started/trivia_content/) that will allow you to store text in multiple languages. Here's an example of `translate_text` content-type:

```js
module.exports = {
  id: 'translated_text',
  title: 'Translated Text',
  renderer: '#translated_text',
  jsonSchema: {
    title: 'Text Message',
    description: 'A normal text message with translations',
    type: 'object',
    required: ['textEn', 'textAr'],
    properties: {
      textEn: { type: 'string', title: 'Text (English)' },
      textAr: { type: 'string', title: 'Text (Arabic)' }
    }
  },
  uiSchema: {},
  computeFormData: formData => formData,
  computeData: formData => formData,
  computePreviewText: formData => formData.textEn + ' / ' + formData.textAr,
  computeMetadata: null
}
```

# Preparing renderers

You could notice we have renderer specified in the previous step.
We should implement custom renderer that renders text based on the state-variable. It could look something like this:

```js
'#translated_text': data => {
  const language = data.state.language || 'En'
  return [
    {
      typing: true,
      markdown: true,
      text: data[`text${language}`],
      'web-style': { direction: language === 'Ar' ? 'rtl' : 'ltr' }
    }
  ]
}
```

Notice that via `web-style` key we are handling the case for right-to-left written languages.
